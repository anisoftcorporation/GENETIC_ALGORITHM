    "## Agent-based Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent-based models are used to simulate many actors or \"agents\" and their actions and interactions. These models differ from ODE models in that rather than averaging the behaviors across actors in the model, each actor is a distinct part of the model and acts according to a specified set of rules. These actors respond to both the environment and other actors within the system. Often, these models are used to simulate epidemics in which the actors represent humans and the interaction between sick individuals and healthy individuals allows for the epidemic to spread. In this project, the actors will be ants and rather than becoming infected with a disease, these ants will be influenced by recruitment via tandem running. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Forager Behavior Problem and Model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Forager Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "As described in the \"Collective Cognition in Ant Societies\" lecture by Dr. Stephen Pratt, a simple feeder experiment can be used to demonstrate how ants collectively select a food source. In this experiment, as shown in Figure 1, two feeders are placed equidistant from a colony nest. Then, the exploration and tandem-running behaviors of ants can be observed. Ants explore the presence of the two feeders and perform tandem runs to recruit ants to the stronger feeder. Please refer to Dr. Pratt's lecture for variations and more details on this experiment. \n",
    "<a id='forager_model'></a>\n",
    "### Forager Model (ODE)\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in Figure 2, Pratt defines a model in which the ants can be in one of three states: (1) uncommitted to a feeder; (2) committed to feeder A; and (3) committed to feeder B. In this model, every ant must be in one of these three states at any time step. To describe how ants transition between states, Pratt introduces $\\beta, \\alpha, $ and $\\lambda$ parameters. The parameters $\\alpha_A$ and $\\alpha_B$ describe the rate at which the uncommitted ants discover feeder A and feeder B respectively. In addition to independent discovery, ants can also be recruited by interacting with those ants who have committed to either feeder. This recruitment happens at the rate $\\beta_A$ for feeder A and $\\beta_B$ for feeder B. Finally, ants are not necessarily committed to a single feeder for the duration of the experiment and may return to the uncommitted state at an attrition rate of $\\lambda_A$ for feeder A and $\\lambda_B$ for feeder B.\n",

This project will be largely based on the introductory tutorial provided by ``Mesa`` and can be found [here](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/intro_tutorial.html) as well as an implementation for pheromone laying ants by Mark Goadrich which can be found on GitHub [here](https://github.com/mgoadric/ants-mesa).  \n",

    "A ``Mesa`` simulation consists of two main classes, one for the model and the other for the agents. Each agent contains information about the state of the individual as well as how one instance of an agent may interact with another. The model class contains information such as the general parameters, and the grid the agents move on, and keeps track of the agents in their current state. \n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in converting an ODE model into an agent-based model is to establish an environment for the agents to exist in. The grid below shows the environment we will be using for this project. The grid is $50 \\times 50$ in dimension and the origin is located at the bottom left. The nest is at the location $(25,5)$ and the strong and weak feeder are at locations $(10, 40)$ and $(40, 40)$ respectively. The class that holds this model is given in the model section [here](#model).\n",

If it is not currently at a food source, or cannot commit due to the alpha parameters, it moves one cell in a random direction. In the ant commits to a food source, its state changes to either \"COMMITTED A\" or \"COMMITTED B\" depending on which feeder it is currently at.

    "## Model Class\n",
    "\n",
    "The ``Model`` class defines a grid and it keeps track of the agents through time. On each time step, the ants who are able to recruit new ants will do so depending on where they are in space and if another ant is available to be recruited. The ``DataCollector`` class is used to keep track of the agents. In particular, the data collector records the amount of food in each feeder at every time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the grid is an instance of the ``MultiGrid`` class. We opt to use the ``MultiGrid`` class because it allows multiple agents to occupy a single cell simultaneously. If ants were not allowed to come into contact with each other, there would be no recruitment. The definition of the model class and the relevant parameter values are set for you. The simulation ends when one feeder is completely depleted. In this case, we expect feeder A to be depleted much faster than feeder B.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameter Values\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter values come from the article \"Linear Recruitment Leads to Allocation and Flexibility in Collective Foraging by Ants\" as discussed in Dr. Pratt's lecture. These values were a result of fitting the ODE model to real data. Note that in the article, one time step was equal to one minute whereas, in our simulation, one time step is equal to one second. For this reason, the parameter values were all multiplied by 60. Additionally, our simulation will have 100 ants.\n"
