    "\n",
    "In this project, you will implement a negative selection algorithm and study its performance. As an introduction, this project will focus specifically on the datasets from the Textor paper. In particular, you will use the Textor algorithm to classify English and non-English strings for a variety of non-English languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the negative selection algorithm on the Textor examples\n",
    "2. Classify languages and report the results\n",
    "\n",
    "### Project question overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a function to calculate the final anomaly score for each language. [Question 1](#question1)\n",
    "2. Write a function to calculate the false positive and true positive rates for each language. [Question 2](#question2)\n",
    "3. Write a function to calculate the area under the ROC curve for each language. [Question 3](#question3)\n"

    "## Implementing Negative Selection\n",
    "\n",
    "The negative selection algorithm is trivial to implement, but if not done carefully the detector generation process can be computationally intensive. In this project, we will use an efficient version of the algorithm that is available here: http://johannes-textor.name/negativeselection.html. The .jar file as well as the source code will also be available for use in the ``negsel_src`` directory. You may wish to refer to the paper: “Negative selection algorithms on strings with efficient training and linear-time classification,” for more information on the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Classifying languages\n",
    "\n",
    "To test the algorithm, first, you will replicate the experiment described in Section 4.1 of the Textor reading “A comparative study of negative selection based anomaly detection in sequence data.” This experiment attempts to distinguish between strings written in two different languages, both using the same alphabet.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you will train an artificial immune repertoire using fixed-length strings taken from the English-language book *Moby Dick*. Then, you will expose this repertoire to both English-language strings and strings from another language, which will be the “anomalies.” If the algorithm is tuned well, it should distinguish the English-language strings from those of the other language.\n",
    "\n",
    "The training data is in the file ``negsel_src/tests/english.train``. The data consists of non-overlapping substrings of length 10 taken from the text. All letters are converted to lower case and contiguous strings of non-letters are collapsed to a single underline character. The data are organized into strings of length 10. The testing data are in the directory ``negsel_src/tests/`` and are as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "- ``hiligaynon.test``, \n",
    "- ``middle-english.test``, \n",
    "- ``plautdietsch.test``,\n",
    "- and ``xhosa.test``. \n",
    "\n",
    "For each testing set, a subset of the strings is English and therefore non-anomalous. Since each test file contains 124 lines of English and 500 lines of the anomalous language, there is only one required file for labeling. In this file, each line has a corresponding label, 0 for non-anomalous (i.e. English strings) and 1 for anomalous strings (i.e. non-English strings). This file is in the directory ``negsel_src/tests/`` and is named ``labels.test``. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm execution details\n",
    "\n",
    "The negative selection algorithm is given as a java executable file (.jar). To run this within a Python notebook we will need to start a subprocess. A subprocess allows us to run external programs and then read their output into the Python code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start a subprocess, we will first need to import the ``subprocess`` module and the ``run`` and ``PIPE`` submodules. Then, we will need to run the process with an array of arguments and the opened input file. We will use the Textor example ([here](http://johannes-textor.name/negativeselection.html)) to demonstrate how subprocesses work.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following command trains the negative selection algorithm on the ``english.train`` data set and tests on the ``hiligaynon.test`` data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "``java -jar negsel.jar -c -n 10 -r 4 -self english.train < hiligaynon.test ``\n",
    "\n",
    "The flags used here invoke the algorithm that counts the matching detectors and uses *4-contiguous* detectors on the sample strings of length 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is a description of all of the available flags for execution:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``-n`` : length of strings in self set\n",
    "- ``-r`` : number of contiguous detectors\n",
    "- ``-o`` : offset into strings\n",
    "- ``-d`` : add to alphabets the digits from 0 to ...\n",
    "- ``-g`` : print debug information\n",
    "- ``-v`` : invert match (like grep)\n",
    "- ``-b`` : subtract baseline noise\n",
    "- ``-c`` : count matching detectors instead of binary match\n",
    "- ``-l`` : output logarithms instead of actual values\n",
    "- ``-k`` : use r-chunk instead of r-contiguous matching\n",
    "- ``-p`` : output k-th component of matching profile (0 for full profile)\n",
    "- ``-self`` : file containing self set (1 string per line)\n",
    "- ``-alphabet`` : file containing alphabet; default: infer (uses all characters from \\\"self\\\" file as alphabet)\n",
    "\n",
    "To run this subprocess, we will need to first build an argument list from the command. This allows the subprocess command to parse the command and flags. Using the command given above, we will construct the following argument list. \n",
    "\n",
    "``args = ['java', '-jar', 'negsel_src/negsel.jar', '-c', '-n', '10', '-r','4', '-self', 'negsel_src/tests/english.train']``\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we will need to open the test file to read from. This step is necessary as the argument list will not recognize the redirection from stdin (``< hiligaynon.test``).\n",
    "\n",
    "``input_file = open('negsel_src/tests/hiligaynon.test', 'r')``\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can use the ``run`` submodule to call the command and pipe the output. \n",
    "\n",
    "``result = run(args, stdout=PIPE, stdin=input_file, universal_newlines=True)``\n",
    "\n",
    "The final results will be stored in ``result.stdout``. This can be saved and parsed later as needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code below shows all of these steps put together and prints the output to the Python console. \n"
